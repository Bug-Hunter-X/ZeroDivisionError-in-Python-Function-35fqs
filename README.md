# ZeroDivisionError in Python
This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: ZeroDivisionError. The `bug.py` file contains a function that attempts to divide by zero, resulting in the error. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a solution to handle this potential error.

## Description
The `ZeroDivisionError` is raised when the divisor in a division operation is zero.  This is a common mistake that can easily crash a program. 

## Solution
The solution involves adding error handling using a `try-except` block to catch the `ZeroDivisionError`.  If an error occurs, appropriate action can be taken, preventing the program from terminating.
